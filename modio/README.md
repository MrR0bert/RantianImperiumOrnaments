# Rantian Imperium Ornaments

In an attempt to convert the entire community to banner-holics, here is a mod with banners to enhance your settlements!

## Contents

What is currently in this mod:

    Rantian Imperium Banner
    Rantian Naval Banner
    Rantian Airforce Banner

All three are more or less a proof of concept and are subject to change, currently only available in the old world and the cape.

## Backstory

It started over at a Discord from the YouTube channel named Rantius. In a dark corner called Artwork, a member by the name of MrMajor shared his beautiful creations, that are banners. Rantius, being the greatest banner-holic alive, instantly loved them. After which I decided to attempt to bring these creations to live inside the game. 

After weeks of ranting, screaming and help from the amazing modding community the first iteration is done for everyone to enjoy!

## Future

There is still work to do, but this had to be released into the wild! So what's on the to-do list?

- MORE BANNERS (of course)
- Billboards and other ornament types
- Add designs for other regions
